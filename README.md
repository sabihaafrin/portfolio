## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
#### i) Undergraduate Thesis : Leveraging Robust CNN Architectures for Real-Time Object Recognition
from Conveyor belt
Overview : In this study, we offer a few algorithms to produce a better result on our customized dataset
from an airport conveyor belt environment to find out if it can recognize objects and human babies for
safety. Our analysis shows that our dataset fits the YOLOv5 architecture fairly well, with quite a better
accuracy. Along with pre-trained deep learning models like VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetv2, YOLOv7,
and ViT, we have also implemented custom CNN models.

#### ii) Object Detection Model Using Pre-trained LLM By Implementing a Multi-step Process That
Combines NLP Capabilities With Computer Vision Techniques (Ongoing)
Overview : In this study, we hope to develop a model which will take text instructions as a prompt for lost
objects and will scan video clips through Computer Vision techniques and give detected frames and
timestamp as an output.
#### iii) Enhancing Understanding of 3D Medical Images with Interactive Visualization and Explainable
AI (Ongoing)
Overview : We intend to use Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches that can be incorporated
into interactive visualization tools for 3D medical images, allowing healthcare providers to navigate and
interact with data in a natural and accessible way while receiving real-time input
